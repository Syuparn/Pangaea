# Origin of name

As you guess, "Pangaea" is named after the Pangaea continent. Residents of Pangaea don't have to cross the ocean at all. Pangaea language is aiming at comfortable one-liner script. You won't be disturbed by the line break *ocean* anymore!

Also, its name starts at "P" because its design is highly inspired by *P-languages* (Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby)!
